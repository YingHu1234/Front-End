			My name is Ying Hu, I have been an account payable specialist for three years. I take care of invoices processing, payment forecast and sales reports, employees' reimbursements, account and GL reconciliation etc. I also have intermediate excel and SAP skills. Besides, I am taking a front-end development class which will bring lots of benefits to my current job.
