			<h3>How It All Started</h3>
	      <p>
         Vi is how everyone come to know the owner/chef/cake designer as. Vi comes from a background of fashion design and merchandising. While at art school she was introduced to some of the most beautiful pastries/desserts through her schoolmates, whom are kind enough to shoer her with souvenir they brought back from Japan, Korea and Europe. That was how she comes to know about macarons, financiers, Breton and the like. She was so fascinated with the taste and beauty of those pastries that she took up wiring a food blog, L’Atelier Vi, aiming to recreate them while she didn’t even know how to work the oven. With passion, she self-taught herself to make that perfect macarons, mousse cakes and everything in between. She continues to do so after art school and after she took a job with corporate America. With tum of events, and trust of a friend, Vi did her very 1st dessert table for her friend’s wedding and everything was history.
